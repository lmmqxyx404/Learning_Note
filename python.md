# about version management
## current solution
perhaps use dev container could be a better choice

## pyenv
It will not share the system lib.
`python3 -c "import ctypes; print(ctypes.__file__)"`

## relative env management.

# pckages
## poetry 
In my opinion

## uwsgi
### todo
`uwsgi uwsgi.ini`
I should specific the python environment.
